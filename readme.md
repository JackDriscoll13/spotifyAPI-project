## Overview

This was one of my first data science projects. Looking back a year and a half later, my process was flawed
and my code was messy. However, it is still a good example of my profiency making api calls and cleaning data 
using pandas. Please see FinalProjectWriteup.pdf for a more detailed breakdown of my process.


This project used the spotify api to explore a wide variety of music data. Through spotify, I
was able to collect relevant information on top artists, genres, and playlists, and effectively store
this information in dataframes that I would later use for analysis. I took data from past coachella
lineups, and enhanced that data with pandas, using the Spotify api to populate columns with
relevant information for each coachella artist. I then compiled this information into new CSVs,
which I used for my final analysis and visualisation  of the data.
